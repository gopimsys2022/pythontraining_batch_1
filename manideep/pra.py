# Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.

# Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:

# Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.

# Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers

# Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers

# Exercises: Level 2
# Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.
# The sum of all numbers is 5050.
# Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

# The sum of all evens is 2550. And the sum of all odds is 2500.
# Exercises: Level 3
# Go to the data folder and use the countries.py file. Loop through the countries and extract all the countries containing the word land.
# This is a fruit list, ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] reverse the order using loop.
# Go to the data folder and use the countries_data.py file.
# What are the total number of languages in the data
# Find the ten most spoken languages from the data
# Find the 10 most populated countries in the world
